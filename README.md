## Answer the questions
My estimated after I read the requirement was 14 hrs, and I was planing to use bootstrap for responsive and less to write css to keep it clean and also plan to use google map instead of image.

Iâ€™m using HTML5 because it support more technology and more browser. CSS3 is very useful to speed up the browser, Javascript is to call library of google map, carousel, and bootstrap and the most important is bootstrap because this is the best way to do responsive.

my test is on http://walkingpenguins.tk/hogarth

To run this project the index.html is in the app directory.
and CSS is in the styles directory

To implement you can modify less in directory less and run gulp watch to compile less to css.

p.s. I attached the whole bower_components but what you need is just a few files in it.
